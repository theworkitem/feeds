    <![CDATA[
    <p>The web is full of podcasts that dole out generic career advice - ‚Äú<em>Follow your passion!</em>‚Äù, ‚Äú<em>Keep learning!</em>‚Äù, ‚Äú<em>Set clear goals!</em>‚Äù This is all good if you're just starting out, but the pointers start to lose their luster quickly as you progress and start hitting invisible walls in your growth.</p>
    <p>All of a sudden, it's harder to get promoted, opportunities to advance become more ambiguous, and the choices in front of you aren't as obvious as they were when you first started your job.</p>
    <p>What does it take to get to the Staff engineer level? If you want to become an executive in the future, what should you do now to maximize your chances of hitting that goal? Should you have a time-bound career map or focus on unique opportunities that pop up serendipitously? Should you try your hand at entrepreneurship, and if so - how do you build a robust safety net?</p>
    <p>For these questions and more, The Work Item is the podcast where I attempt to answer them with help from folks that went through trial by fire. They are not social media thought leaders - they are <em>actual practitioners</em> who have first-hand experience dealing with some of the more thorny challenges in this industry.</p>
    <p>With folks like <a href="https://theworkitem.com/episodes/tools-do-not-matter-jason-lengstorf/">Jason Lengstorf</a> (Founder, Learn With Jason), <a href="https://theworkitem.com/episodes/stop-building-landing-pages-craig-hewitt/">Craig Hewitt</a> (Founder, Castos), <a href="https://theworkitem.com/episodes/cash-money-with-saron-yitbarek/">Saron Yitbarek</a> (Founder, CodeNewbie), <a href="https://theworkitem.com/episodes/put-the-passion-aside-rob-walling/">Rob Walling</a> (Founder, MicroConf), <a href="https://theworkitem.com/episodes/career-moats-cedric-chin/">Cedric Chin</a> (Founder, CommonCog), <a href="https://theworkitem.com/episodes/building-sustainable-practices-jason-fried/">Jason Fried</a> (CEO, 37signals), <a href="https://theworkitem.com/episodes/ori-moon-studios-gennadiy-korol/">Gennadiy Korol</a> (CEO, Moon Studios), <a href="https://theworkitem.com/episodes/reflecting-on-the-year-mayuko-inoue/">Mayuko Inoue</a> (iOS Engineer, Apple), <a href="https://theworkitem.com/episodes/camille-fournier-engineering-paths/">Camille Fournier</a>, and <a href="https://theworkitem.com/episodes/">many, many more</a> you will get <em>extraordinary</em> insights that will help you unlock your career potential beyond the basics you'll learn elsewhere.</p>

      <title>#91 - The Future Of Software Engineering - Simon Guest (CTO, Code.org)</title>
      <itunes:image href="https://cdn.theworkitem.com/art/episode-logos/s06e04.png" />
      <description>
        Every year, millions of students try coding for the first time through Hour of Code. But most people don't know that the technology powering those experiences is ran by someone who didn't really have a plan to become a CTO. In the fourth episode of this season of The Work Item, I am talking with Simon Guest, CTO at Code.org. Simon walks me through how he actually became a CTO (not the LinkedIn version we commonly see), and what skills helped him succeed despite the fact that there was no pre-charted path he could follow. You'll be surprised to learn just how much serendipity and having the skills in the right place at the right time play a role in strapping one's career to a rocketship. We also talk about the future of coding, whether AI is truly going to make engineers obsolete, and what we can do to build a good career moat that sets us up for long-term success. And of course, if you've ever wondered what it takes to move into technology leadership, this conversation will give you a very realistic picture of what that path looks like.

      <title>#90 - The Death Of SaaS Has Been Greatly Exaggerated - Lianna Patch &amp; Colleen Schnettler (Co-Founders, SaaS Marketing Gym)</title>
      <itunes:image href="https://cdn.theworkitem.com/art/episode-logos/s06e03.png" />
      <description>
        In this week's episode, I sat down not with one, but two brilliant guests - the duo behind the brand-new venture known as SaaS Marketing Gym, Lianna Patch and Colleen Schnettler. As coaches and community leads for SaaS founders, they offer a refreshing counterpoint to the doom-and-gloom narratives trending on YouTube and other social channels about AI rendering software businesses obsolete. Through Lianna's conversion-focused (and delightfully humor-filled) copywriting expertise and Colleen's technical background, they're equipping SaaS founders with marketing strategies that prove software businesses aren't just surviving the AI revolution‚Äîthey're positioned to thrive alongside it. What made our conversation so compelling was their evidence-backed optimism (a rare treat, I know) about the future of SaaS. While tech pundits predict AI will replace traditional software services, Lianna and Colleen articulate exactly why human-designed software solutions remain vital and how founders can use AI as an enhancement to what they're building rather than a replacement. Our discussion covers both the challenges of the current landscape and the surprising opportunities AI creates for SaaS companies that want to ride the wave. We talk about their origin stories and how they continuously evolve their skills to stay ahead of the curve. I guarantee you that you'll walk away with immediately actionable tactics and insights regardless of your company stage, and perhaps most valuably, a renewed confidence that SaaS remains a business model with staying power.

      <title>#89 - So You Want to Be a CTO - Taiwo Oyeniyi (CTO, Distrobird)</title>
      <itunes:image href="https://cdn.theworkitem.com/art/episode-logos/s06e02.png" />
      <description>
        Chief Technology Officer - a few people I've talked to in the past year expressed some degree of interest in reaching, what seems like, the pinnacle of an engineering career. That three-letter title carries weight in boardrooms and across the industry alike. But beyond the fancy business cards and the seat at the executive table, what does it actually mean to hold the technical helm of an organization? Is it the promised land of pure architectural decisions and strategic vision, or something messier, more complex, and perhaps more rewarding in unexpected ways? Today, we're peeling back the curtain on the CTO role with Taiwo Oyeniyi, who'll share his journey from engineer to executive. Rather than relying on generic career advice or job descriptions, we'll hear firsthand about the transition, the challenges, and the realities of the position. Taiwo will explore the skills that matter most (spoiler alert: they might not be the ones you're cultivating now), the hurdles he faced along the way, and how the role has transformed his relationship with technology.

      <title>#88 - Best-Kept Secrets on Becoming a Great User Researcher - Marisa Morby (Principal Researcher, Observable)</title>
      <itunes:image href="https://cdn.theworkitem.com/art/episode-logos/s06e01.png" />
      <description>
        User research is an underappreciated art - we in tech are so used to being immersed in an ocean of quantitative data that we can forget that on the other side of the screen are real humans who want to solve very specific problems. And often times, their problems are extremely hard to put a number on. Why did they abandon their cart right before checkout? What made them start creating a new newsletter but then abandon it but come back a month later? Not everything can be answered with a SQL query against the telemetry database. Marisa Morby, a Principal Researcher at Observable, sat down with me to help me better understand what it means to be great (not just good) at user research, and how that can help produce a whole new range of unexpected product insights. And Marisa definitely knows what the impact of great user research can be on the product - she previously worked at such notable companies like Netlify, Gatsby, and Accenture Song, where she honed her skills and UX instincts.

      <description>
        This is the last episode for 2024. To make it special, it's a supercut of all the unconventional advice from every single guest that was on the show this year - Kent C. Dodds, Jerod Santo, Rob Walling, Adrienne Tacke, David Khourshid, Saron Yitbarek, Rachel Andrew, Katie Fujihara, Lena Reinhard, Miriam Suzanne, Kirupa Chinnathambi, Craig Hewitt, Jennifer Wong, Jason Lengstorf, Michael Kennedy, and Asia Orangio. This turned out so well, that I will be definitely re-visiting the format in the new year. I hope you have a successful and adventure-packed 2025, with plenty of room for career growth. See you next year!

      <description>
        If you've been immersed in the tech world for some time, you probably have heard one specific YouTube channel mentioned more than once - Learn With Jason. It's a project started by Jason Lengstorf, a former VP of developer experience at a web tooling startup (he was a head of developer relations prior to that too), that is aimed at helping everyone navigate the always changing landscape of developer tools and frameworks. Which, by the way, according to Jason do not matter. In this show, we dive deep in Jason's career path and focus on the less known aspects of climbing the career ladder - things like amassing political capital by doing great work, building visibility by meaningful means that can help cement your reputation, and being able to address business problems as a mechanism to build trust in your own leadership abilities.

        Jennifer Wong is a seasoned engineering manager who started her journey in civil engineering. The fast pace of the tech industry drew her in, and she stuck with it for years since making that call. In this episode, I chat with Jennifer about her transition from a non-traditional career path into software, reasons to take on management instead of being an individual contributor, and why taking the road less traveled in terms of career progression might just be the recipe for long-term growth and success.

      <description>

      <description>
        One of the things that Miriam Suzanne realized early in her developer journey is that web development is a tool - she wanted to build a website for her theater company and ended up building a career and a company around it. And not just that, but she also joined the CSS Working Group - the official standards body that determines how the CSS stack evolves. In this show, we talk about her early discovery of the power of the web, how she joins creativity with technical prowess, and how CSS is really like poetry written in the browser.

      <itunes:image href="https://cdn.theworkitem.com/art/episode-logos/s05e09.png" />
      <description>
        We often talk about promotions and growth, but the moment the conversation shifts towards paths to staff or executive positions, the advice goes blank. There is very little actionable information out there that can tell you how you can get to the highest echelons of leadership. To get a clearer picture on this topic, I sat down with Lena Reinhard, a seasoned executive with an extensive track record at CircleCI, Travis CI, and more. Lena shares her insights on the best ways to accelerate career growth in the tech space, answer thorny questions, such as ‚ÄúWhy are executives hired from the outside?‚Äù and provide some candid takes on why taking things slow sometimes can pay off in the end.

      <description>
        One's journey from their early career to working at startups in Silicon Valley can take many forms. Some folks take the more traditional route of joining a company right after college. Others get tired of their corporate life and decide to try something different. Katie Fujihara, an engineer and a technical program manager amalgam, decided that her journey to the heart of ‚Äústartup land,‚Äù San Francisco, would be an impromptu one - she just packed up her bags and set out on an adventure. I am delighted to share with you this recording, where I talk to Katie about her early starts in Hawai'i, how working in engineering was not the end goal for her career journey, and what the best practices are for overcoming impostor syndrome.

      <description>
        For today's episode, I had the privilege of sitting down with Rachel Andrew, arguably one of the more influential folks in the world of web development. With a career spanning over two decades, Rachel has left an indelible mark on the web developer community. From her groundbreaking work on CSS to her role as co-founder of Perch CMS (she spent 20 years as a freelancer and a business owner), Rachel's contributions have shaped the way we build and interact with the web. Throughout her career, Rachel has not only demonstrated technical prowess but also a remarkable knack for empowering others through her writing (and now, her team's writing as well). As an acclaimed author, speaker, and advocate for web standards, she has tirelessly championed inclusivity and accessibility in the digital realm.

      <description>
        One of the things that is a bit taboo to talk about, both in the tech industry and outside of it is money. People just aren't comfortable discussing openly the hard decisions that go into things like seeking funding, investing money into things that save you time, and scaling your own abilities with the help of, you guessed it, cold, hard, cash. Saron Yitbarek, entrepreneur extraordinaire behind CodeNewbie and podcasts such as Command Line Heroes, generously accepted my invitation to chat and talk about all these things, and more. And of course, we talk about Saron's latest project - Big Cash Money 2024, something for folks that want to max out their income beyond just their salary.

      <itunes:image href="https://cdn.theworkitem.com/art/episode-logos/s05e05.png" />
      <description>
        In this episode of The Work Item, I had a conversation with David Khourshid, founder of Stately.AI. You might know him as @DavidKPiano on social media. Today, we're breaking new ground around unconventional paths of building an engineering career, entrepreneurship, and leveraging your audience as the potential first customers for your product. And of course - we talk a bit more about state machines (David is also the developer behind XState) and lessons learned from launching and growing a startup in the midst of a pandemic.

        What do you think are the top skills you need as a product manager? What is a product manager, to begin with? As a product manager myself, I could theorize a lot on these questions but instead I thought I'd ask someone who is not me, and has a wealth of experience in the field - the CEO of Product School, Carlos Gonzalez de Villaumbrosia. Carlos and I dive deep into the product management field, discussing the differences between PM categories, what it means to become the best PM one can be, and what the outlook is for the next five years for those that want to break into the field.

      <description>
        Anson Cheung is a San Francisco-based industrial designer with more than ten years of experience shipping hardware. It's not often that we talk to someone who produces physical things, and naturally I was excited to learn more about what Anson works on and how we can discover pathways into an industrial design career track. In this show, we discuss Anson's origins, working with a large design firm vs. going solo, and what are some ways in which an aspiring industrial designer can hone their craft without investing thousands of dollars.

      <description>
        Welcome friends to the fourth season of The Work Item podcast. I am starting the yearly series with some fantastic guests, and today is no exception. To start us off, I am chatting with Cedric Chin - the founder of the CommonCog blog and business series. You might've read some of Cedric's writing on career moats before (I know I have). Cedric has a wealth of experience in managing engineering teams and has embarked on a quest to build a deep understanding of business and development principles from the ground-up. We're glad you're here, listening to this show. Enjoy!

      <title>#60 - Defining A Force Multiplier, with Sam Saccone</title>
      <itunes:image href="https://cdn.theworkitem.com/art/episode-logos/s03e13.png" />
      <description>
        When we choose our career path, we often try to optimize for one specific bucket - you're a product manager, or a project manager, or a UX designer, or any other variation of an expertise area in tech. Sam Saccone defies the expectations of a single role and instead believes in being a ‚Äúplumber‚Äù - doing whatever work is necessary to enable others to do their own version of great work. I sat down with Sam to learn more about his path to a Senior Staff Engineer at Google, what it means to brute-force your way through problems, and what the best avenues are to become a force multiplier for your team.

      <description>
        Leaving your full-time job behind and starting your own business based on your own brand is a somewhat scary proposition. And yet, this is exactly what Donny Wals, a prolific iOS developer and technology teacher, is doing. In this episode I sat down with him to talk more about his work, what was his thinking in going solo, and what one needs to learn quickly in an ever-changing technology space.

        Working on games is hard. It's even harder to go from an engineer to a founder of a game studio that is able to produce two blockbuster titles in a row. In today's show I chat with Moon Studios co-founder Gennadiy Korol about his work on Ori (if you're near an Xbox or a PC - the game is worth your time), learning the complexity of graphics engineering, and navigating the uncertainty that comes from starting a zero-to-one effort where you have nothing to fall back on.

      <description>
        If you are a web developer, chances are that you used CodePen more than once. You're also probably very familiar with CSS-Tricks for, well, more than just CSS tricks. The man behind these experiences, Chris Coyier, actually started his journey some time ago with a programming language called Turbo Pascal - many steps removed from web development. I sat down with Chris to talk more about his career, lessons in getting CodePen out into the world, and so much more.      </description>

I sat down with Chris to talk more about his career, lessons in getting CodePen out into the world, and so much more.</p>

      <title>#56 - Reverse Engineering The Halo API with Alexis from HaloDotAPI</title>
      <itunes:image href="https://cdn.theworkitem.com/art/episode-logos/s03e09.png" />
      <description>
        If you ever played any of the Halo games, you probably know that there is a _wealth_ of data being exchanged between the game and Halo services. This includes stats and so much more. If you've ever wanted to use those stats, you also probably ran into HaloDotAPI - a Halo API wrapper for Halo Infinite and Master Chief Collection. Behind all of this work is one individual - Alexis, or Zeny_IC (on both Twitter and Xbox Live).

        <p>If you ever played any of the Halo games, you probably know that there is a <em>wealth</em> of data being exchanged between the game and Halo services.

        <p>Today I chat with Alexis about his early roots, what led him to explore reverse engineering as a viable career path, as well as what it took to actually figure out the Halo API.</p>

      <itunes:image href="https://cdn.theworkitem.com/art/episode-logos/s03e06.png" />
      <description>
        There are a few things in your engineering career that you should focus on relentlessly, but few as impactful as finding yourself a guide through the journey, as well as develop a set of complementary skills that can help accelerate your own trajectory. I chatted with Nicole Zhu, Senior Engineer at Vox Media, about the importance of mentorship, peer feedback (or any feedback, for that matter), and how skills that are not directly related to writing code can be more helpful to success than you anticipate.

      <title>#49 - Product Management in Government, with Director of Product Management for the City and County of San Francisco, Adrianna Tan</title>
      <description>
        Despite starting a career in product management at one of the big companies, I've never considered to do the same job but working for the government. Not because I didn't want to. Mainly, because I did not know that was even an option. As it turns out - it is, in fact, an option, and a pretty impactful one at that. To learn more about this career trajectory, I chatted with Adrianna Tan, Director of Product Management for the City and County of San Francisco. She shares her journey as a founder of startups and non-profits, an avid hiker and an advocate for an open web, and how it all combines in her work.

      <title>#47 - 2021 Reflections, Creativity, and More, with Mayuko Inoue</title>
      <description>
        The end of 2021 is almost here, and it's time to wrap up the second season of The Work Item. And what better way to do that than to invite a good friend on the show to talk about their journey through the past 12 months? In this episode, I am chatting with Mayuko Inoue about all things 2021, the best choices in comfort foods, McDonalds french fries, thoughts on the content creator career path, and more. We wanted to make this episode very informal, yet informative. To borrow Mayuko's intro to her own podcast, Muko's Corner (which you should subscribe to) - sit down, get cozy, grab a cup of tea, and enjoy the show!

      <title>#46 - From Journalism to Developer Engagement, with Christina Warren</title>
      <description>
        The myth of the superhero programmer - we often hear about it, but it's rarely the reality. Being a superhero on a team takes more than just technical chops, and that's one of the topics that I chat about today with Senior Developer Advocate at Microsoft - Christina Warren. You might've seen Christina before on This Week on Channel 9, or even back in the day - at Gizmodo and Mashable. This episode ended up being less of a career chat and more of a friendly exchange about the latest happenings and what we can learn from them. Yes, we even talk a bit about the re-released Grand Theft Auto: The Definitive Edition.

      <description>
        The decision to join a startup or a big company is not an easy one, as one has to consider many factors that go beyond just the financial side of things. In this episode, I talk to Jennifer Kim, a seasoned startup advisor with a lot of experience dealing with these kinds of decisions and more. Jennifer also specializes in the people part of the startup equation - arguably, one of the hardest ones. We chat about the current challenges startups encounter in this space, why it's important to build a diverse workforce, and what one individual can do to be a changemaker in their company's culture.

      <description>
        You've probably heard of the many types of PM - project managers, product managers, and even program managers. But did you also know that there is a PMM - product marketing manager? I wasn't quite sure what the responsibilities of one would be, so I reached out to Isaac Levin - Principal Product Marketing Manager at Elastic, and asked him to talk about his work.

      <title>#43 - Ins And Outs Of Developer Advocacy, with Brian Douglas</title>
      <description>
        Developer Advocacy is a relatively new field, but when it comes to knowing how to navigate it, Brian Douglas' knowledge is second to none. As Director of Developer Advocacy at GitHub, he is at the forefront of a lot of the developer engagement efforts - from understanding the pain points of those that use GitHub, to advocating for new initiatives and programs. I sit down with Brian to learn more about what it takes to be a great developer advocate, how one can break into the field, and how you measure success in the role. Suffice to say - it was a packed conversation and we needed more time and maybe even a future follow-up to cover everything.

      <title>#42 - Building The World You Want To See, with Jeff Atwood</title>
      <description>
        Whether you are new in the tech industry or are a veteran developer, chances are that you've used a product that Jeff Atwood worked on. I'm talking about Stack Overflow and Discourse, of course. When it comes to building communities and fostering good conversations, Jeff took an unusual position - steer the conversation towards finding the best in people, argue ideas and not people, and ultimately, contribute to a world that's just a bit better. How does it all work? Jeff elaborates in this episode.

      <title>#41 - Why Big Tech Is Not For Me, with Chloe Shih</title>
      <description>
        Despite what your LinkedIn feed might tell you, a career in FAANG is not the only way to grow in tech. Or even get started in tech, for that matter. There are many variables in play that can help you determine what career track to pursue, but none more important than the answer to your own ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù That's why today I am talking to Chloe Shih, a product manager and content creator, about her journey to a product manager role, struggles along the way, and the realization that work in Big Tech might not be all that interesting or impactful.

      <title>#40 - Engineering and Team Empathy, with Amro Mousa</title>
      <itunes:summary>
        Management, and especially engineering management, is way more than just telling others what to build. Talking to Amro Mousa, an engineering manager at Twitter, it becomes evident that a key ingredient to a good team is empathy. In this episode, I learn from him on what the best way is to lead with empathy in a team, and how one should think about the management track as a potential avenue in their career.

      <title>#39 - Focus on Delivering Value, with Dan Shaw</title>
      <description>In the sea of shiny technology objects (I am talking frameworks, tools, libraries, and many others), Dan Shaw has been pretty opinionated - focus on delivering value to the customer first, and tools second. In this episode, I sit down with Dan to learn more about this approach, and how he applied it in his career and work with the Node.js community - after all, he's known as the Godfather of Node.js.

      <title>#38 - Becoming a Polymath, with Salman Ansari</title>
      <description>From the early days - when we are growing up, to when we go to school, we tend to be involved in a lot of activities. From sports, to music, painting, coding classes. But as we grow up, we tend to specialize. One is a product manager, or a Python programmer, or even a doctor. According to my good friend Salman Ansari, this is where we have an opportunity to break out of the typical norms and become a polymath - a person with extensive knowledge in several domains. In this episode, I learn more about Salman's career, as well as his take on how someone can become a polymath.

      <itunes:summary>Last time I chatted with Jack, I had pages of questions I still wanted to ask - with this episode, I attempt to address that backlog. And the more I talked to Jack, the more I realized that the theme of his entire career is - ‚Äúbe a builder.‚Äù As someone who started and worked at many startups, he sure knows first-hand how to do that well and in a way that is sustainable. Today, we talk about his work at Vimeo, what it means to collaborate with others, and how to build a network of folks that are there when you need them most.

And the more I talked to Jack, the more I realized that the theme of his entire career is - ‚Äúbe a builder.‚Äù As someone who started and worked at many startups, he sure knows first-hand how to do that well and in a way that is sustainable.</p><p>Today, we talk about his work at Vimeo, what it means to collaborate with others, and how to build a network of folks that are there when you need them most.</p><p>You can find Jack on the following sites:</p><ul><li><a href="https://twitter.com/jackzerby">üê§ Twitter</a></li><li><a href="https://jackzerby.com/">üìù Blog</a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jackzerby/">ü§µ LinkedIn</a></li><li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/0lT1sFnszlq9JFPnNvaDZY?si=eUUSOpvDSZ-zIVqNCZO4ZA">üéµ Spotify</a></li></ul><p>The podcast was produced by <a href="https://den.dev">Den Delimarsky</a>.

      <title>#36 - Diving Into Open Source Engineering, with Jenn Creighton</title>
      <itunes:summary>There is a bit of a chasm between requirements for building open source projects and those that are designed to be closed. Not surprisingly, it also requires a different set of skills altogether if you want to do it right. To learn more about this, I sat down with Jenn Creighton, Senior Staff Open Source Engineer at Apollo GraphQL. Jenn has been building scalable web experiences at companies such as Ralph Lauren, Chartbeat, and ClassPass, and is now leading the work on one of the most interesting and active open projects out there.

      <title>#35 - From Pre-Med To Product Management, with Janine Co</title>
      <itunes:summary>I often hear about folks moving from engineering to product management and back. Others make the transition from marketing and sales to product management. In a first for this show, today I talk to Janine Co, a product manager who recently joined the Microsoft Teams team, who also happened to switch from following a pre-med path to one in product. What things did she consider when making the switch? What did Janine do to build a network from scratch? It's all in this episode.

      <title>#29 - Building Things You Love, with Ben Sandofsky, Head of Development for Halide</title>
      <description>From Pascal, to writing image processing code, if there is one word you absolutely can't use to describe Ben Sandofsky‚Äòs career, it would be ‚Äúuneventful.‚Äù He was one of the first mobile engineers at Twitter, had a stint helping build Periscope, and ultimately ventured into unexplored territory to finish a photo app he always wanted, that later became Halide. In this episode, I sit down with Ben to get a better understanding of the decisions he made in his career, and what were the critical turning points that made him start his own studio - Lux.
